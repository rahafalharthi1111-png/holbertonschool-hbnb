# High-Level Package Diagram

## Explanatory Notes:

The following <mark style="background-color: lightblue;">high-level package diagram</mark> illustrates the three-layer architecture of the HBnB application and the communication between these layers via the facade pattern. This diagram will provide a conceptual overview of how the different components of the application are organized and how they interact with each other.

## Description:

1. **Presentation Layer (Services, API):** This layer handles the interaction between the user and the application. It includes all the services and APIs that are exposed to the users.
2. **Business Logic Layer (Models):** This layer contains the core business logic and the models that represent the entities in the system (e.g., User, Place, Review, Amenity).
3. **Persistence Layer:** This layer is responsible for data storage and retrieval, interacting directly with the database.
